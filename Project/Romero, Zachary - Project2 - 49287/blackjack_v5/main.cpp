 * I think the biggest difference the versions will have is 
 * a more accurate simulation of the cards/deck
 * also implementing doubling-down
 * this will make it actual blackjack
 * not sure how to improve the UI
 * would need to implement GUIs for that to really be a thing but I have no idea how
 * I will try and take notes from your card and deck implementation and not copy too much

//i have realized that not everything needs to be object-oriented
    //despite my best efforts i'm still not quite at the level to understand how to make everything without just completely copying you
    //instead i am just going to implement as many concepts as i can not with the game logic but rather the betting system
    //i think i can flesh it out more and have it be nice, still unsure how to meet the 1000 line minimum
    // just trying to simulate the game at this point, just to see how it goes
//version 5 will try to implement the betting system
//more fleshed out to have a bank class that is aggregated with the player class's constructor
//hopefully i can then implement a vector in the STL library to store each chip
